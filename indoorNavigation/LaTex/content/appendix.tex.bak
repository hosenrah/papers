\subsection{Further Smart City definitions}

\begin{quote}[\textcite{smart1}]
“A Smart City is a city well performing built on the ‘smart’ combination of endowments and activities of self-decisive, independent and aware citizens.”
\end{quote}

\begin{quote}[\textcite{smart5}]
“Smart City is the product of Digital City combined with the Internet of Things.”
\end{quote} 

To understand this quote one definition for Digital City follows: 

\begin{quote}[\textcite{digital1}]
“A Digital City has at least two plausible meanings: (1) a city that is being transformed or re-oriented through digital technology and (2) a digital representation or reflection of some aspects of an actual or imagined city.” 
\end{quote}

\begin{quote}[\textcite{smart6}]
“Concept of a Smart City where citizens, objects, utilities, etc., connect in a seamless manner using ubiquitous technologies, so as to significantly enhance the living experience in 21st century urban environments.” 
\end{quote}

	\item Psychology
	\begin{itemize}
		\item As first step into the subject of psychology we looked for the psychological aspects of innovation processes. The first result on that topic was the master Thesis \textcite{MSMueller}.
		\item As one of the main Sources from this Thesis we found the standard work \textcite{rogers2003diffusion} explaining i.a. the process off diffusion for innovations.
		\item This leads to \textcite{DiffusionsprozesseFRA} where references back to \textcite{MSMueller} are found. 
	\end{itemize}
	\item Sociology
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Sociological aspects in Smart Cities
		\item Sociological impacts of position tracking on the example of GPS are explained in \textcite{holmes2005impact}.
		\item To get an impression on how human beings make decisions on known facts in contrary to their gut instinct we found the work \textcite{gigerenzer2007bauchentscheidungen}.
		\item This leads to the work \textcite {singer2003neues} where brain researcher Wolf Singer explaines how social and cultural factores influence mental development.
		\item Sociological aspects of Positioning systems

	\begin{itemize}
		\item After contacting the HP CTO about Indoor navigation we received a link to a Microsoft competition \textcite{microsoftIPSN}.
		\item This lead to 20 papers describing different approaches for Indoor Navigation: \textcite{platz1}, \textcite{platz2}, \textcite{platz3}, \textcite{platz4}, \textcite{platz5}, \textcite{platz6}, \textcite{platz7}, \textcite{platz8}, \textcite{platz9}, \textcite{platz10}, \textcite{platz11}, \textcite{platz14}, \textcite{platz15}, \textcite{platz16}, \textcite{platz17}, \textcite{platz18}, \textcite{platz19}, \textcite{platz20}, \textcite{platz21}, \textcite{platz22}. These papers are giving an overview but are not containing technical details. For the technologie we will focus on later additional research must be done.
